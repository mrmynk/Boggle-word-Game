Summary:
I have followed Singleton Design pa,ern to design the architecture of this prototype game.I tried to follow SOLID principles as much as I can. If I could get more Qme on this, I will try to make my code loose coupled and sQck with SOLID principles .I will make it more clean with good Naming and Comments which can help to understand the code be,er.
